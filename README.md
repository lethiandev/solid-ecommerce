# ECommerce Demo Website
An ecommerce demo website built on top of [Solid.JS](https://www.solidjs.com/) UI library with REST API based on [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/). The project is just a prototype SPA-like website for sole purpose of experimenting with new JavaScript library. The code is not production ready and probably won't ever be.

You can always preview the website hosted on GitHub Pages -
